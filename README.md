# CIFARImageClassification
 Image classification of the CIFAR 100 dataset using CNN and NN

This project was part of my Big Data and Machine Learning module in my 3rd year of university. The assignment was to compare two different machine-learning methods for image classification. I chose to look at the difference in performance between a neural network and a convolutional neural network. The assignment required a minimum classification accuracy of about 30%, however, using data generation techniques I was able to produce an accuracy of 51% for the CNN without over or undertraining the model.
